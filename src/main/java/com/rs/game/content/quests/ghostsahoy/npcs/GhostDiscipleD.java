Mortal Remains
Attempting to open the door on the first floor of the Ectofuntus' temple
Ghost disciple: What are you doing going in there?
Player: Err, I was just curious...
Ghost disciple: Inside that room is a coffin, inside which lie the mortal remains of our most glorious master, Necrovarus. None may enter.
Attempting to open the door without an amulet of ghostspeak on
Ghost disciple: Woooo wooooo woooo
You get the general impression that the ghost doesn't want you to open the door.
