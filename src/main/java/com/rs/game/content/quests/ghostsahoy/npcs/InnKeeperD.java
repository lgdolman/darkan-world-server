Laundry Duty
Asking the bartender for jobs
Player: Do you have any jobs I can do?
Ghost innkeeper: Yes, actually, I do. We have a very famous Master Bowman names Robin staying with us at the moment. Could you take him some clean bed linen for me?
Player: Yes, I'd be delighted.
Ghost innkeeper: Oh, thank you. Be careful with that Robin, though â€“ he's far too full of himself, that one.
Player: No, I didn't mean a job like that.
