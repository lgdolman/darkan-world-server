Shipwrecked Surprise
Player: What is your name?
Old man: I don't remember. Everyone around here just calls me 'boy'.
Player: You're the cabin boy?!?
Old man: Yes, and proud of it.
Player: Can I have the key to the chest?
Old man: Hang on, let me ask the Captain...
The old man cocks an ear towards the Pirate Captain's skeleton.
Old man: The Captain says no.
Player: Is this your toy boat?
The old man inspects the toy boat.
If there is no flag
Old man: No – I made a toy boat a long while ago, but that one had a flag.
If the flag is the wrong colours
Old man: No – I made a toy boat a long while ago, but the colours on the flag were different.
If the flag is the correct colours
Old man: My word – so it is! I never thought I would see it again! Where did you get it from?
Player: Your mother gave it to me to pass on to you.
Old man: My mother? She still lives?
Player: Yes, in a shack to the west of here.
Old man: After all these years...
Player: Can I have the key to the chest, then?
Old man: Hang on, let me ask the Captain...
The old man cocks an ear towards the Pirate Captain's skeleton.
Old man: The Captain says yes.
The old man gives you the chest key.
Talking to the old man after getting the chest key
Player: How is it going?
Old man: Wonderful, wonderful! Mother's coming to get me!
