Eastern Curiosities
Player: It's nice to see a human face around here.
Ak-Haranu: My name is Ak-Haranu. I am trader, come from many far across sea in east.
Player: You come from the lands of the East? Do you have anything that can help me translate a book that is scribed in your language?
Ak-Haranu: Ak-Haranu may help you. A translation manual I have, much good for reading Eastern language.
Player: How much do you want for it?
Ak-Haranu: Ak-Haranu not want money for this book, as is such small thing. But there may be something you could do for me. I am big admirer of Robin, Master Bowman. He staying in village inn.
Player: What would you like me to do?
Ak-Haranu: Please get Master Bowman sign an oak shieldbow for me, so Ak-Haranu can show family and friends when returning home and become much admired. Then I give you book in exchange.
Player: Okay, wait here – I'll get you your bow.
Player: Sorry, I have too much to do at the moment.
