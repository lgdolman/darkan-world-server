Just Say Neigh to Gambling
Player: Would you sign this oak shieldbow for me?
Robin: I'm sorry, I don't sign autographs. While you're here though, why don't you have a game of Runedraw with me? If you've got 25 gold pieces I've got a bag of runes we can use.
Player: Yes, I'll give you a game.
Player: How do you play Runedraw?
Robin: Two players take turns to draw a rune from a bag, which contains ten runes in total. Each rune has a different value: an air rune is worth one point, up to a Nature rune which is worth nine points. If a player draws the Death rune then the game is over and they have lost. A player can choose to hold if they wish and not draw any more runes, but this runs the risk of the other player drawing more runes until they have a greater points total and win.
Player: No, I don't approve of gambling.
After winning at least once
Player: So are you going to pay up then? You owe me [25/50/75] gold coins!
Robin: How about another game? I'll pay you back with the winnings.
Player: What if you lose again?
Robin: Er... we'll deal with that when we come to it.
Player: Yes, I'll give you a game.
Player: How do you play Runedraw.
Player: No, you didn't pay up the last time you lost.
After winning at least once and then losing a game
Player: Well done, you beat me. But you still owe me [25/50/75] gold pieces.
Robin: Err... how about another game? We can settle up after we've finished playing.
Player: Yes, I'll give you a game.
Player: How do you play Runedraw.
Player: No, you didn't pay up the last time you lost.
After winning four times
Player: I've had enough of you not paying up â€“ you owe me 100 gold coins. I'm going to tell the ghosts what you're doing.
Robin: Please don't do that!!! They will suck the life from my bones!!!
Player: How about you signing my shieldbow then?
Robin: Yes, anything!!!
Robin signs the oak shieldbow for you.
Talking to him again
Player: So, still here then.
Robin: Do you want another game of Runedraw?
Player: You have a serious gambling problem, you know.
