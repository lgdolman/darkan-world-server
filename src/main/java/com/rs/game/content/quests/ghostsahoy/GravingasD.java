Peaceful Protest
Gravingas: Will you join with me and protest against the evil desires of Necrovarus and his disciples?
Player: After hearing Velorina's story I will be happy to help out.
Gravingas: Excellent, excellent! Here â€“ take this petition form, and try and get 10 signatures from the townsfolk.
The ghost hands you a petition.
Player: I'm sorry, I don't really think I should get involved.
 */

/*
Gravingas: You've got them all! Now go and present them to Necrovarus!!
 */

/*
Speaking to Gravingas afterwards
Gravingas: So have you presented the petition to Necrovarus?
Player: Yes. He burned it.
Gravingas: That's exactly what I thought he would do.
Player: Well, if you knew that he would do that, why have I been wasting my time running around after ghosts for signatures?
Gravingas: It never hurts to get involved in politics.
